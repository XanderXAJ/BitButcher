Bit Butcher -- An NDS ROM Trimmer in Java
-----------------------------------------

Notice:
	Be sure to back up any images you feed through this program, just in case
	something does go wrong.  At this stage, there's always that chance!

Usage:
	If you have yet to compile the program, then make sure you have at least the
	1.6 JDK installed and run:
		
		javac ButButcher.java
		
	Once it has been compiled, simply run:
	
		java BitButcher rom1 rom2 romN...
	
	This program modifies the original files, so make sure you have copies
	just in case.	

Options:
	None yet.  But there are plans!
	
	In particular:
		+ Change ROM buffer size

About:
	BitButcher has been (so far) written entirely by Alex Palmer, also known
	as XanderXAJ.  If you like what you see, be sure to check out my personal
