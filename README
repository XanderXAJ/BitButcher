BitButcher -- An NDS ROM Trimmer in Java
-----------------------------------------

Notice:
	Be sure to back up any images you feed through this program, just in case
	something does go wrong.  At this stage, there's always that chance!

Usage:
	If you have yet to compile the program, then make sure you have at least the
	1.6 JDK installed and run:
	
		javac BitButcher.java
	
	Once it has been compiled, simply run:
	
		java BitButcher rom1 rom2 romN...
	
	This program modifies the original files, so make sure you have copies
	just in case.	

Options:
	None yet.  But there are plans!
	
	In particular:
		+ Change ROM buffer size

FAQ:
	Q: Where did the name come from?
	A: A friend suggested that I rename the program (which was originally just
		called "Trimmer") to this.  Turns out I liked it.
