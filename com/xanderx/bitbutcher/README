BitButcher -- An NDS ROM Trimmer in Java
-----------------------------------------

Notice:
	Be sure to back up any images you feed through this program, just in case
	something does go wrong.  At this stage, there's always that chance!

Usage:
	If you have yet to compile the program, then make sure you have at least the
	1.6 JDK installed and run:
	
		javac com/xanderx/bitbutcher/*.java
		jar cfm BitButcher.jar com/xanderx/bitbutcher/manifest com/xanderx/bitbutcher/*.class
	
	Once it has been compiled, simply run:
	
		java -jar BitButcher.jar [-pi] rom1 rom2 romN...
	
	This program modifies the original files, so make sure you have copies
	just in case.
	
	Unless you have a particular reason to do so, it is usually best to run
	BitButcher with no options.

Terms:
	AEO
		Application End Offset â€” A special part of the Nintendo DS's ROM header
		that specifies how large the data stored in the ROM is (regardless of
		the size of the file).  BitButcher uses this information to quickly
		trim a file.
		
		Care must be taken, however, as for some reason games that have wi-fi
		support are often 136 bytes larger than the value specified in the AEO.
		BitButcher can cope with these instances.
		
		Additionally, the ROM header could be bad (due to a bad dump or cartridge),
		meaning anything could happen!  Running BitButcher with the -pi options
		will help out here.

Options:
	-p	Paranoid.  Makes BitButcher scan from the end of the file to verify no
		useful data will be removed.  ROM will be trimmed to the first point
		useful data is found or to the size specified in the AEO, whichever is larger.
		
	-i	Ignore AEO. Only useful with -p. Only use this if the ROM header is bad.
		Forces BitButcher to ignore the AEO and just scan from the end of the file
		for useful data.  ROM will be trimmed to the first point useful data is found.
	
FAQ:
	Q: Where did the name come from?
	A: A friend suggested that I rename the program (which was originally just
		called "Trimmer") to this.  Turns out I liked it.
